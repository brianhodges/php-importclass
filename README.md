# Use Class/Object File (PHP)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future PHP projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted .txt file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/php-importclass
  cd php-importclass
  php main.php
  ```
*Formatted log.txt file will output to the project root*
